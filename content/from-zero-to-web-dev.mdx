For the past 4.5 months, I’ve been learning to code more seriously. There was no big goal or challenge behind it — I just wanted to improve my skills and understand how real projects are built.

## How It Started

I didn’t follow a perfect roadmap.  
I started with the basics, watched tutorials, read documentation when I got stuck, and tried to build small things every day.

In the beginning, even simple concepts felt confusing.  
But slowly, after repeating them enough times, things started making sense.

## What I Worked On

Most of the time went into experimenting and trying out different ideas:

- Building small UI components  
- Creating simple full-stack apps  
- Learning how APIs work  
- Setting up authentication  
- Connecting databases  
- Debugging random errors  
- Understanding folder structure and clean code

Many of these projects are not perfect — some I even deleted — but each one helped me learn something new.

## The Challenges

There were many days where I felt stuck:

- Bugs that wasted hours  
- Features that didn’t work the first time  
- Trying to understand backend concepts  
- Losing focus sometimes  
- Rewriting the same thing multiple times

But eventually, after repeating things enough, I started to recognize patterns and understand why things work a certain way.

## What Improved

I’m not an expert, but I definitely feel the difference:

- I can now build small projects more confidently  
- I understand React, Node, and basic backend flow better  
- Debugging doesn’t scare me as much  
- Reading documentation has become easier  
- I’m more consistent than before

## What’s Next

I want to keep building more real projects, improve my logic, and slowly work on more advanced topics. There’s still a long way to go, but these 2.5 months gave me a good start.

More updates coming soon as I continue learning and building.
